All right.
Thanks, Tony.
I just want to record a line.
How can I help you today?
Hi, Jeff.
This is Tony.
I have Mr. Ward on the line.
Mr. Ward has an income of $2,300.
He has over $10,000 unto care debt.
He's currently paying right now about $3.75.
He's trying to get a lower payment of $2.50 with zero interest.
Can you help him out?
Yeah, sure.
Okay, Mr. Ward, you're in great hands, man.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Mr. Ward, you're in great hands, right?
Thank you.
We'll talk to you later.
Yes, sir.
As I told the young man, I'm not home right now.
I can't give you any information.
I don't have it with me.
Well, we don't technically need information like that.
I mean, I can always look you up and to see what's on a soft pool
and to see what you have.
Okay.
But with that being said, I mean, what they did was they switched
you over here to us.
My name is Justin Springer, and this is Debt Blue.
Here at Debt Blue, we have over 20 years of experience when it comes
to debt relief.
We are a federally regulated lender and a debt reduction company
all in one house.
So my job is just to help you identify the best option to consolidate
and possibly reduce the total amount of debt that you owe.
Okay.
Yes, sir.
How much debt do you think you're dealing with?
Well, once you hear debt, I'm probably dealing with about 22,
23,000.
But I have student loan for about 98,000.
Gotcha.
Okay.
And have you looked into any type of debt consolidation loan
or any other type of option like I'm dealing with that?
Yes.
I wrote him.
I was on a debt consolidation thing right now.
Oh, I see.
Okay.
How long have you been doing that?
About a month and a half, two months.
Gotcha.
Gotcha.
Has your credit score already taken that hit?
Yeah.
I mean, it was down below 500.
Okay.
So I haven't checked it here lately.
I can't imagine it being much better.
Yeah.
Well, I mean, the best thing that I can do for you is give you the exact same
program.
See, we do debt consolidation loans as well as debt resolution program.
Obviously, if your credit score is not as up to par,
you probably wouldn't get approved for the loan.
Sir, I don't mean to be rude,
but there's telephone call coming in.
I must take this phone call.
Okay.
Sounds good.
I do appreciate your time.
Yes, sir.
And thank you.
Appreciate your time.
Bye.
Bye-bye.
You have been kicked from this conference.
