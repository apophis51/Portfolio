                    <br>
                    <p>I'm self taught in Python and the Flask framework, and completed a Fullstack JavaScript Course. I often use Python + Selenium + Spacy for document processing and SEO work, as well as REGX expressions, pickle files, and xls processing to accomplish my goals</p><p>Working on building up my shopify .liquid knowledge to launch my own applications. Im also intrested in Solidity and Machine Learning.</p>

                    <h2>Going Back: </h2>
                    <p>I'm Malcolm Vernon. I served in the United States Air Force from 2007 to 2014, and after my service, I started working on my degree.</p>

                        <p>I made a switch from Physics and Electrical Engineering and ended up completing my Associate's degree, as well a 2 years worth of my Electrical Engineering Degree from the University of Colorado Denver. However, my degree was cut short when I decided to pursue my sweetheart, at the time, in Poland.</p>
                        
                        <p>After a bit of a breakup, I unexpectedly found myself in Ukraine, without a job. However, I started working for a friend of mine doing small jobs as an SEO Specialist, which eventually turned into a full-time job within a few months.</p>
                        
                        <p>I moved to Michigan to work full time at his location, but then Covid hit, and I ended up spending that time at my family's location in South Carolina.</p>
                        
                        <p>My friend's contract entitled him to 32% of the company's revenue, and they did not want to renew our contract, so in August 2022, I found myself without a job after working as an SEO for 3 years.</p>
                        
                        <p>Fortunately, I discovered that as a veteran, I was entitled to a free Software Bootcamp through the new VET-Tech program, so I signed up!</p>
                        
                        <p>I graduated from FullStack Academy in May 2023, with a focus on PostgreSQL, Express, React, and Node. I also have previous exposure to the C programming as well as a strong grasp of Python and Flask from my own independent study.</p>
                        
                        <p>I have also dedicated a significant amount of time to Machine Learning. While I am not an expert, I have enjoyed gaining exposure to various ML libraries, including Pandas and Scikit-Learn.</p>
                        
                        <p>I prefer full-stack development but I am open to all opportunities!</p>
                        
                        <p>Thank you.</p>
